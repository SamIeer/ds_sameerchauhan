 <h1>Web3 Trader Sentiment Analysis — Fear vs Greed Prediction</h1>

This project explores the relationship between trader behavior and market sentiment using the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index and real trading data. 
The goal was to analyze how profit, trade volume, and activity differ during Fear and Greed periods,
and to build a simple machine learning model capable of predicting the sentiment of a given trading day.

Using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn) in Google Colab, I performed data cleaning, feature aggregation, exploratory analysis, 
and visualization to uncover behavioral patterns.
I then developed baseline models — Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest — achieving up to ~74% accuracy (Decision Tree). 
The study revealed that average daily profit (closed_pnl) is the most influential factor distinguishing Greed days from Fear days.

This project demonstrates a complete data science workflow — from dataset preparation to model evaluation and report generation. 
The final analysis provides clear insights into trader psychology, showing that market optimism correlates with profitability and trade confidence,
while fear is marked by cautious, low-return behavior.
